msgid "Purpose"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:7
msgid ""
"**CUDA Driver (`cuda`)**: Allows TileLang to be imported on systems without "
"a GPU (e.g., CI/compilation nodes) by lazy-loading `libcuda.so` only when "
"needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:8
msgid ""
"**Runtime & Compiler (`cudart`, `nvrtc`)**: Resolves SONAME versioning "
"mismatches, enabling a single build to work across different CUDA versions. "
"This is achieved by reusing the existing CUDA runtime loaded by frameworks "
"like PyTorch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:10
msgid "Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:12
msgid "The stubs in `src/target/stubs/` implement a lazy-loading mechanism:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:14
msgid ""
"**Lazy Loading**: Libraries are loaded via `dlopen` only upon the first API "
"call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:15
msgid ""
"**Global Symbol Reuse**: For `cudart` and `nvrtc`, the stubs first check the "
"global namespace (`RTLD_DEFAULT`) to use any already loaded symbols (e.g., "
"from PyTorch)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:16
msgid ""
"**Versioning Support**: Handles ABI differences between CUDA versions (e.g., "
"`cudaGraphInstantiate` changes in CUDA 12)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:18
msgid "Build Option"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../runtime_internals/stubs.md:20
msgid ""
"`TILELANG_USE_CUDA_STUBS` (Default: `ON`) controls this behavior. When "
"enabled, TileLang links against these stubs instead of the system CUDA "
"toolkit."
msgstr ""
