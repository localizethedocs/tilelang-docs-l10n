"Tile Language (tile-lang) is a concise domain-specific language designed to "
"streamline the development of high-performance GPU/CPU kernels (e.g., GEMM, "
"Dequant GEMM, FlashAttention, LinearAttention). By employing a Pythonic "
"syntax with an underlying compiler infrastructure on top of TVM, tile-lang "
"allows developers to focus on productivity without sacrificing the low-level "
"optimizations necessary for state-of-the-art performance."
