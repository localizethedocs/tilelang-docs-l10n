"**LOG**: Standard logging preserved in code for displaying necessary "

"**DLOG**: Debug logging for developer debugging output. DLOG is controlled "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorials/logging.md:28
msgid ""
"The key difference between LOG(DEBUG) and DLOG is this build-time "
"elimination. We recommend using DLOG over LOG(DEBUG), as the latter has "

msgid ""
"**VLOG**: [Verbose logging](https://google.github.io/glog/stable/logging/"
"#verbose-logging), primarily for debugging. Its main feature is customizable "
"verbosity levels. For example, VLOG(n) where n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, "
"enabling complex tracing requirements. In contrast, LOG and DLOG typically "
"use predefined verbose levels like INFO and DEBUG."
